        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the
            Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized
            in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
