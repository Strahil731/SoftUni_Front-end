    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and
        CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.Web browsers have a dedicated
        JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized insome servers and a variety of
        apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
        (DOM).</p>
